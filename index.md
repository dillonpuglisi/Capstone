I can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dillonpuglisi/Capstone/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, from the content in my Markdown files.

Page is accessible through this [link](https://dillonpuglisi.github.io/Capstone/).

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling my writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dillonpuglisi/Capstone/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
